# Productivity Is Really About What You Don’t Do.

The best productivity tip I ever got was the idea of a “stop-doing list” from Jim Collins. In this Age of Distraction, we’re all dodging and weaving between so much incoming information that what you don’t do on a daily basis has become as important—if not more—as what you do execute on.


Here’s a list of the things I don’t do while working:

- Schedule meetings in the morning.
- Listen to music or radio that has words.
me.
- Work more than 3 hours without a break.
- Over-program my daily schedule so that there is no downtime.
- Eat at my desk.
- Work 6pm-1am.

Email, Social & News:

- Look at my email/Answer my phone or texts until I’ve done 60 mins of deep-attention work.
- Look at social media, news until the afternoon, and then only on breaks.


And here’s a list of things I make sure to do:

- Make my to-do list for tomorrow the night before.
- Focus on deep-attention before hyper-attention work.git
- Always have 3 projects on my slate so I can shift tasks based on my mood and energy level, while still getting important stuff done.
- Do meet (or catch up with) one interesting person a week.
- Regularly identify and update my goals for the next 6 months, and the actions I need to take to meet them.
