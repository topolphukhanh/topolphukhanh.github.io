# Lambda 2.0 Big data architecture.
Lambda Big data architecture with AI deploying.

In a big data product to use AI functions, architecture is nothing but without or weaknesses in architecture, everything is nothing.

To make solution in the function of product for millions users, today people use the artificial intelligence technology.
With data logs, It may be recommendation items, optimization price, fixed price, flash sale, campaign marketing, game rules, ... any things else to treat customers in a user/group level.

Beside the general challenges of big data architect solutions (performance, available, scalability, flexibility, cost), 
sometime there is a specific requirement such as Agile in Data Analytics, Reactive for important events in
real-time. 

Researching and implementing the big data architecture can respond to real-time event with AI algorithms is dream picture of most of curious children. 

With some experience in real-time architecture, "great things are done by a series of small things brought together", it is Big-data-specific technology.

You began with some module AI algorithms which is general topic research in AI fields, combine them to get "full system solution" so that it has ability to solve problem in a product function.

Then you research big data technology, to get general knowledge. It is most of time with book, blog.
And then you thought pipeline of data, and how it works in a system to meet the initial requirements. 
Configuration, testing, explain, monitoring, adjusting to improve.

At last, when you look your architecture again, it nearly like the solution of big names.
Not only the big names have sample products type, but also the big name have different products type.
So on, ability to effectively combine "Big-data-specific technologies" is good "Big data solution architect engineer".

The accuracy of sequence model (1% most popular items constitute) is 51%. 
(8.8% of the interactions in Movielens dataset, 22.4% in Netflix dataset and 28.6% in RSC15 dataset).
It's fun.

[Steven Jobs quote](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/researchinadvertisingfinal-140409215258-phpapp01/95/research-in-advertising-idea-killer-or-sharpener-53-638.jpg?cb=1397080548)
“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.”
