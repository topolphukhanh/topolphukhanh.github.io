# Lambda 2 Big data architecture.

In a big data product to use AI functions, architecture is nothing but without or week in architecture, everything is nothing.

To make solution in the function of product for millions users, today people use the artificial intelligence technology.
It may be recommendation items, optimization price, campaign marketing, game rules, ... any things else to treat customers in a user/group level.

Beside the general challenges of big data architect solutions (performance, available, scalability, flexibility, cost), 
sometime there is a specific requirement such as Agile in Data Analytics, Reactive for important events in
real-time. 

Researching and implementing the big data architecture can respond to real-time event with AI algorithms is dream picture of almost engineer. 
With my experience in real-time architecture, "great things are done by a series of small things brought together", it is Big-data-specific technologies.

You began with some module AI algorithms which is general topic research in AI fields, combine them to get "full system solution" so that it has ability to solve problem in a product function.
Then you learn big data technology, to get general knowledge. It is almost time with book, blog.
And then you thought pipeline of data, and how it works in a system to meet the initial requirements. 
Configuration, testing, monitoring, adjusting to improve.

At last, when you look your architecture again, it nearly like the solution of big names.
Not only the big names have sample products type, but also the big name have different products type.
So on, ability to effectively combine "Big-data-specific technologies" is good "Big data solution architect engineer".
