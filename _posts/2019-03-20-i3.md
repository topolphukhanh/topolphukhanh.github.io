I follow the reference from a master Kaggle to choose i3wm in ubuntu for my laptop.
He said that i3 is subjectively + 10% to my performance.

After more than a half of year to use, I completely agree with him.

It supports tiling, stacking, and tabbing layouts, which it handles dynamically ... 
But i think the best feature that is that it's "simple". 
No icon, no click, no time to think about layout. 
It just only command in terminal, you must learn command to use.
This way is like to interactive the servers. Help you to be comfortable with config severs.
In the big data fields, especially understand package big data technology and computing library, configuration linux is essential skill.
