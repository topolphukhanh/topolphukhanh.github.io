I follow the reference from a master Kaggle to choose i3wm in Ubuntu for my laptop.
He said that i3 is subjectively + 10% of my performance.

After more than a half of the year to use, I completely agree with him.

It supports tiling, stacking, and turbine layouts, which it handles dynamically... 
But I think the best feature that is "simple". 
No icon, no click, no time to think about the layout. 
It just only commands in terminal, you must learn commands to use.

This way is like to interact the servers. Help you to be comfortable with config severs.
In the big data fields, especially understand package big data technology and computing library, configure Linux is an essential skill.
