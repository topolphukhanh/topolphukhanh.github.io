I follow the reference from a master Kaggle to choose i3wm in ubuntu for my laptop.
He said that i3 is subjectively + 10% to my performance.

After more than a half of year to use, I completely agree with him.

It supports tiling, stacking, and tabbing layouts, which it handles dynamically ...vv. 
But i think the best feature it gave me is that it's "simple". 
No icon, no click, no though about layout. It just only command in terminal, this way is like to interactive the servers.
Experience from config i3 helps me to save time in learning linux. 
In the big data fields, especially understand package big data technology and computing library, configuration linux is essential skill.
