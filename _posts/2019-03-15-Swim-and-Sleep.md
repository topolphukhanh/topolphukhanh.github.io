# Swimming

More than 2 weeks I swiming in the morining at ~6.15 am. 
The target was gradually increase. I began with 6 rounds of swiming pools (a rounds is about ~50 meters). And now I hold a target with 12 rounds each day, increase 1 rounds in two days, and keep up 20 rounds a day.
I hope to finish the hiking with 45 kilometers in the end of April. 
That is fun and effective with the well-arranged plan.

Mozart of Chess, Magnus Carlsen. He plays sport a lots. He work exercise everyday none can concentration 7 hours per day.


# Sleeping

I determine to follow the program "Sleep Polyphasically As Much As You Like".
The reason I find it superior is quite obvious when you bring up a few things that SPAMAYL-sleeper can do: 

- Sleep 3-5 times a day (on a regular day), no need fixed schedule
- Need about one minute to fall asleep 
- Don’t need to be sleepy or use a bed to fall asleep 
- Can do back to back naps (20 minute between) without any negative effects 
- Capable of staying awake for 12 hours without any problems by timing/adding naps 
- Are capable of drinking alcohol by adding extra naps 
- Need not fear missing a nap and ruin your sleep rhythm 
- No need of a “veggie” diet 
- Most of the naps are during the night.

But with me, it is dependence on my emotional state, happy or worries. Need to improve!
