It will be better if you have the right perception, to respond smartly.

The best leaders we have observed are fully aware of the multiple cultures within which they are embedded, can sense when change is required, and can deftly influence the process.

Cultural norms define what’ts encouraged, discouraged, accepted or rejected within a group and when aligned with personal values and needs, enerrgizes teams to work toward a shared purpose.

Someone said that culture eats strategy for breakfast và các nghiên cứu chỉ ra rằng ngay cả kế hoạch tốt nhất cũng có thể bị trật bánh (and research show that even the best-laid plan can be derailed) if leaders don’t understand the power and dynamics of company culture.

 

Culture corporation:

Dimension 1:

How people respond to change?

stability     ><><    flexibility

Dimension 2:

How people interact?

independence    ><><  interdependence

Strategy and culture are among the primary levers at top leaders’ disposal in their never-ending quest to maintain organizational viability and effectiveness. Strategy offers a formal logic for the company’s goals and orients people around them. Culture expresses goals through values and beliefs and guides activity through shared assumptions and group norms.

Strategy provides clarity and focus for collective action and decision making. It relies on plans and sets of choices to mobilize people and can often be enforced by both concrete rewards for achieving goals and consequences for failing to do so. Ideally, it also incorporates adaptive elements that can scan and analyze the external environment and sense when changes are required to maintain continuity and growth. Leadership goes hand-in-hand with strategy formation, and most leaders understand the fundamentals. Culture, however, is a more elusive lever, because much of it is anchored in unspoken behaviors, mindsets, and social patterns.
